Hi there 👋👋 !

I'm Boheng Li (李勃衡), a Ph.D. student at the [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. [Tianwei Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tianwei.zhang/index.html). I received my B.E. from the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering (SCSE)](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), China, where I was advised by Prof. [Run Wang](http://wangrun.github.io/). During my undergraduate studies, I also worked as a research intern at the [State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security](http://fit.zju.edu.cn/fitcn/2023/0406/c34346a2738118/page.htm), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), China, collaborating with Dr. [Yiming Li](https://liyiming.tech/).

My research interests focus on trustworthy machine learning, with a particular emphasis on responsible (multimodal) generative models.

🌟🌟 I am open to discussions and potential collaboration opportunities. If you're interested in working with me, don’t hesitate to send me an email!
